    The name of our group is MarkupMasters-Team 05.Our team's goal is to share
    our Coding and IT expertise with others. Our skills and experience have 
    been useful for various purposes. Our team's goal is to create and deliver 
    more interesting content to you. We took part in the "Hour of Code" event,
    which we carried out as a team of 5 at the Informatics Center of Sumgayit city.
    Our main goal in creating this website is to explore the fields of HTML, CSS 
    and JavaScript, not only to gain new knowledge, but also to cover them.

  <p>
      On March 30, the goal of our four-person team was to introduce the basic 
      concepts of coding in the Informatics center in Sumgayit city, to implement
      the "Hour of Code" event using the studio.code.org website and the"blocking"
      technique. During our discussions, students showed great interest in learning
      more about computer science and improving their programming skills.After class,
      several students approached us eager to find additional resources to supplement
      their learning.During the session, we also informed the children about
      ADA University. We even learned that some children have dreams of 
      studying at ADA University. The Hour of Code session held by Team 5 was
      undeniably successful thanks to the dedication and collaborative efforts
      of its members. By creating an engaging and interactive learning environment,
      the session achieved the goal of enhancing students' programming skills and 
      igniting a passion for continuous exploration in the field of computer science. 
      We rewarded them with certificates after the training.
