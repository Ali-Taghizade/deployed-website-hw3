            <p class="hourOfCode-text">On the 30th of March, 2024, Team 5 orchestrated a remarkable Hour of Code event at the Informatics Center in Sumgait city, ushering in a transformative experience for a group of twenty students, aged between 12 to 14, from grades 7-8. Guided by an unwavering dedication to fostering a dynamic learning environment, the team navigated through various challenges to ensure a successful and enriching session.

                The journey began with meticulous planning, as the team endeavored to secure an appropriate venue. Despite initial setbacks, including logistical constraints with Ali's school location, the team persevered, ultimately finding a fitting space at the Informatics Center, courtesy of Emil Jafarov's coordination.
                
                The session kicked off with a captivating presentation led by Ali Taghizade, shedding light on the myriad benefits of studying at Ada University. Ali's detailed exposition on the bachelor's level curriculum in computer science, coupled with insights into prerequisite subjects and elective options, captivated the students' interest and kindled aspirations to pursue higher education in the field.
                
                Emil Hajiyev then delved into the fundamentals of programming, employing relatable examples to demystify concepts such as loops and conditional statements. The transition from theory to practice was seamless, as students eagerly engaged in coding exercises, supported by Ayan and Emil Hajiyev's guidance. Through collaborative problem-solving and personalized assistance, the team nurtured an inclusive learning environment where students felt empowered to explore and innovate.
                
                The integration of Code.org's curriculum with elements from the popular Angry Birds game proved to be a stroke of genius, infusing the session with excitement and interactivity. As students maneuvered through coding challenges within the familiar confines of the Angry Birds universe, laughter and enthusiasm filled the room, underscoring the effectiveness of gamified learning in capturing young minds.
                
                The culmination of the session witnessed not only enhanced programming skills among the students but also a newfound enthusiasm for computer science. Post-session discussions revealed a strong desire among students to delve deeper into the subject, reflecting the profound impact of the team's efforts.
                
                In conclusion, Team 5's Hour of Code event stands as a testament to the power of collaboration and innovation in education. By leveraging creative teaching methods and fostering a supportive learning environment, the team succeeded in igniting a passion for computer science among young learners, paving the way for future exploration and discovery in this exciting field.</p>
